## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Mohammad, a third-year Computer Science student at BGU.
I have a deep passion for volunteering, video editing, and spending time by the sea.
This GitHub profile showcases my work, including academic assignments and personal projects.
I'm excited to share what I've learned and created, both within and beyond the university.
